            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            Dreams are doomed to die in Night City, a futuristic Californian metropolis. As a teenager living in the city's slums, David Martinez is trying to fulfill his mother's lifelong wish for him to reach the top of Arasaka, the world's leading security corporation. To this end, he attends the prestigious Arasaka Academy while his mother works tirelessly to keep their family afloat.

            When an incident with a street gang leaves David's life in tatters, he stumbles upon Sandevistan cyberware—a prosthetic that grants its wearer superhuman speed. Fueled by rage, David implants the device in his back, using it to exact revenge on one of his tormentors. This gets him expelled from the academy, shattering his hopes of ever making his mother proud.
            
            After witnessing David's newfound abilities, the beautiful data thief Lucyna "Lucy" Kushinada offers to team up with him, handing him a ticket to salvation. However, associating with Lucy introduces David to the world of Edgerunners—cyborg criminals who will break any law for money. Edgerunners often lose their lives, if the cyberware does not break their minds first; but in his fight for survival inside a corrupt system, David is ready to risk it all.

        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>This was very enjoyable even though I didn't like the game. The association of Trigger studio's unique animation direction with a more conventional story makes for a very compelling show. Although even if I am only calling conventional when compared to other Trigger shows, it is rather original if put against the average seasonal show. Every aspect of this show makes it stand out, from the franz ferdinand opening to the bright coloring that is seen throughout the shpw.
            The only flaw I can think of is how short the anime is : only ten episodes. Therefore you only see a glimpse in many characters but that is also what makes this show: a concetrated experience that hit in the face and ends suddenly.
